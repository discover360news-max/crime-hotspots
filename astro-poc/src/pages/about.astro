      <h2 class="text-heading font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-700">Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        <strong>Crime Hotspots</strong> is a regional initiative designed to
        create greater awareness and provide accessible, data-driven insights
        into serious crimes across the Caribbean. Our goal is to help
        communities, journalists, and policymakers better understand crime
        patterns through verified reporting and transparent data aggregation.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-heading font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-700">How We Collect Data</h2>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        All statistics presented on this platform are compiled from verified
        media reports, police statements, and open-source data. Each incident
        is <strong>cross-referenced with reputable news sources</strong> before
        inclusion to maintain accuracy and credibility.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        Location markers shown on maps represent estimated positions based on
        available information. While the
        <strong>Area and Street Address</strong> fields reflect accurate data
        from verified reports, map coordinates may be approximate and are not
        intended for investigative use.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-heading font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-700">Data Sources</h2>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        Our crime data is currrently sourced from:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Trinidad Express</li>
        <li>Guardian TT</li>
        <li>Newsday</li>
        <li>CNC3</li>
        <li>Community social media sources (Ian Alleyne Network, DJ Sherrif)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-heading font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-700">Transparency and Accuracy</h2>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        While we use <strong>Google's Gemini and Claude AI</strong> to help structure thousands of reports for speed, 
        we maintain a 'Human-in-the-loop' architecture. Every high-severity incident is 
        manually reviewed by our editorial team before it appears on the map. This hybrid approach 
        ensures we provide the speed of AI with the accountability of traditional journalism.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        Every entry on our platform is explicitly linked back to its original
        source article, allowing users to verify the context and details
        immediately.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-heading font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-700">Why the Caribbean?</h2>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        The Caribbean region often faces fragmented crime reporting. <strong>Crime Hotspots was founded 
        to bridge this gap</strong>, providing a unified, visual dashboard that empowers residents with 
        the same level of data transparency found in major global metropolises. 
        We believe that accessible data is the first step toward safer communities.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-heading font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-700">Privacy and Ethics</h2>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        We adhere to strict ethical standards. Our platform focuses on crime
        statistics and trends. We do not solicit or publish private, unverified
        information. We only reflect details that have already been made public
        by the originating news source, maintaining data fidelity to the public
        record.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-heading font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-700">Fact-Checking Policy</h2>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mb-6">
        We only report incidents confirmed by at least two independent sources or an official police statement.
      </p>
