  {
    category: "Data Accuracy and Sources",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Where does Crime Hotspots get its crime data?",
        answer: "Our crime data is sourced exclusively from public reports by established media outlets like the Trinidad Express, Guardian TT, Newsday, Stabroek News, and Kaieteur News. For Trinidad, we also monitor specific high-traffic community social media feeds. This ensures we provide real-time crime statistics reflecting the public record."
      },
      {
        question: "How often is the crime map updated?",
        answer: "We are committed to providing the freshest data possible. Our automated systems check Guyana crime reports hourly and Trinidad crime data every two hours. However, we display data with a 3-day lag to ensure completeness and accuracy. This means when you visit the site on January 4th, you'll see complete data through January 1st. This lag accounts for delayed media reporting and allows our AI validation systems to process incidents thoroughly. High-severity incidents undergo immediate human validation."
      },
      {
        question: "What year of data am I viewing when I first visit the site?",
        answer: "By default, all dashboards and maps show data from the current year (e.g., 2026 data in 2026). This ensures you're seeing the most recent crime trends and statistics. You can easily switch to view previous years' data using the year filter available in the Filters menu on each dashboard."
      },
      {
        question: "Is your data based on official police statistics?",
        answer: "No. We aggregate incidents as they are reported by the media, not official police records. This means our figures reflect media coverage and public awareness, not necessarily the official, verified crime counts. We recommend cross-referencing our crime trends with government statistics for formal research."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you use AI to analyze the crime reports?",
        answer: "Yes, we utilize Google Gemini AI to extract structured data (Crime Type, Date, Location) from unstructured news articles. This AI-driven extraction ensures consistency and speed across thousands of reports. All high-severity incidents are subject to mandatory human oversight before publication to ensure accuracy."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "How to Use the Platform",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How can I find the crime rate for my specific area or town?",
        answer: "Use the interactive crime map on the Dashboard page. You can filter by Crime Type (e.g., Murder, Robbery) and select your specific town or area in the Caribbean from the drop-down menu. The map aggregates incidents, helping you visualize local crime hotspots."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I view data from previous years?",
        answer: "Click the 'Filters' button on any dashboard or headlines page. In the filters menu, use the 'Select Year' dropdown to choose which year's data you want to view (e.g., 2025, 2024). You can also access our comprehensive archive by clicking 'View Archive' to browse crime data organized by year and month."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I filter the data by specific dates or crime types?",
        answer: "Yes. All dashboards offer advanced filtering tools. On the Dashboard, you can filter by year and crime type. On the Headlines page, you can filter by date range (from/to dates), crime type, and area. The filters update your view in real-time, showing you exactly the data you need."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I read the crime map?",
        answer: "The map uses incident markers placed at the generalized location of the reported crime. Clusters of markers indicate a crime hotspot. Tap on any marker to view the source article and all structured details, including the Crime Type and the date of the incident."
      },
      {
        question: "Is historical crime data still available after a new year starts?",
        answer: "Yes! All historical data remains permanently accessible. When a new year begins (e.g., 2027), the dashboard will automatically default to showing the current year's data, but you can access any previous year (2026, 2025, etc.) using the year filter or by visiting our archive section. We maintain complete records from when we started tracking each island."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Coverage and Limitations",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What regions in the Caribbean do you cover?",
        answer: "We aim for comprehensive national coverage, tracking incidents reported by major media outlets across all islands. However, our data density naturally favors metropolitan areas due to higher media reporting in those zones."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the main limitations of your crime data?",
        answer: "Our key limitation is that we only reflect media-reported crimes. We do not account for unreported crimes or incidents that receive no press coverage, especially in remote rural areas. Our data represents media visibility, which may contain geographic biases."
      },
      {
        question: "Why are exact street addresses often not shown on the map?",
        answer: "While our source reports often contain exact addresses, we generalize the location to the nearest street junction or area name to maintain focus on community-wide trends rather than specific residences. This also helps balance data specificity with safety considerations."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do some locations on your map have names different from the local name?",
        answer: "We prioritize geographic accuracy for researchers and official bodies. Our location data is extracted and validated against government and official mapping standards, ensuring the names used correspond to recognized administrative or municipal boundaries. This means a locally known neighborhood name may be mapped under the broader, official name of the area that it geographically falls into. We use these precise definitions to provide accurate regional crime statistics to our policy users."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Privacy and Reporting",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Does Crime Hotspots protect privacy?",
        answer: "Yes, we adhere to strict ethical standards. Our platform focuses on crime statistics and trends. We do not solicit or publish private, unverified information. We only reflect details that have already been made public by the originating news source, maintaining data fidelity to the public record. For complete details on how we collect and protect your data,"
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer a way to report crime or submit a tip?",
        answer: "Yes. We provide a secure crime tip line form on our platform where you can report crime anonymously. This information is used to support local community awareness and is managed with confidentiality."
      }
