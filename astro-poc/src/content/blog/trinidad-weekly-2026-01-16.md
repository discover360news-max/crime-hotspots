## Executive Summary

The weekly crime audit for **January 10–16**, 2026, indicates a **30% increase** in total reported incidents across Trinidad and Tobago compared to the first week of the year. While homicides saw a marginal decline, the period was characterized by a sharp rise in aggressive property crimes and proactive law enforcement interventions. **Beetham Gardens** and the wider **Port of Spain** region emerged as primary areas of concern due to high-value seizures and violent incidents.

## Key Statistics

- **Total Incidents:** 77
- **Murder:** 7 incidents (↓ 30% from last week)
- **Robbery:** 15 incidents (↑ 7% from last week)
- **Home Invasion:** 7 incidents (↑ 250% from last week)
- **Seizures (Guns/Drugs):** 11 incidents (↑ 83% from last week)
- **Shooting (Non-fatal):** 6 incidents (↑ 200% from last week)
- **Assault:** 5 incidents (↑ 25% from last week)
- **Burglary:** 6 incidents (↑ 50% from last week)

## Regional Breakdown

### Beetham Gardens & Port of Spain

This region recorded the highest impact from law enforcement operations this week. Most notably, a **massive cannabis haul valued at $8.6 million** was recovered in Beetham Gardens. Port of Spain also continued to see high levels of street-level robbery and larceny, particularly in high-traffic commercial zones.

### Diego Martin & St. James

Western Trinidad showed a pattern of high-intensity violence and illegal weaponry. Statistics include a fatal stabbing following a wake in Diego Martin and the recovery of an M16 assault rifle by police in the same area. St. James recorded a significant carjacking where a high-value SUV was stolen at gunpoint.

### Penal & Mayaro

These southern and eastern districts experienced a cluster of violent home invasions. In Penal, a family of six was targeted and restrained, while in Mayaro, a particularly brutal attack resulted in a father being assaulted and his residence destroyed by fire. These incidents suggest a **shift in criminal focus toward residential vulnerabilities** in less urbanized areas.


## Crime Type Analysis

### Home Invasion

The most alarming trend this week is the **250% increase** in home invasions. Moving from 2 reported cases to 7, these incidents have shifted in nature from simple theft to violent confrontations involving the restraint of entire families. This suggests **organized criminal elements are targeting residential properties** where they believe cash or high-value assets are kept.

### Robbery and Social Media Scams

Robberies remain the most frequent incident type, totaling **15 for the week**. Analysis shows a recurring pattern involving **"social media setups,"** where victims are lured to specific locations through Facebook Marketplace or online dating platforms. These incidents often involve the theft of large sums of cash or the hijacking of vehicles during the meeting.

## Trends and Insights

**Weaponry Escalation:** There is a persistent presence of high-powered military-grade weaponry in the hands of civilians. The seizure of an M16 rifle this week highlights the ongoing challenge of illegal arms proliferation.

**Violent Property Crime Shift:** While the murder rate decreased, the surge in non-fatal shootings and home invasions indicates that criminal activity has become more aggressive in the pursuit of property and assets.

**Targeting of Commerce:** Criminals are actively monitoring cash-heavy business transactions. Reports of contractors and church officials being robbed of significant sums suggest that targets are being selected based on perceived liquidity.

## Safety Recommendations

Based on this week's data, we recommend:

- **Residential Security:** Residents are advised to reinforce entry points and consider alarm systems that include panic buttons. In light of recent home invasions, community neighborhood watch groups should increase communication during evening hours.

- **Online Marketplace Safety:** When conducting transactions via social media, always meet at a designated "safe zone" or a police station parking lot. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash; use digital transfers where possible.

- **Awareness in Hotspots:** Be vigilant when attending public gatherings or wakes in high-risk areas, as these have recently been sites for reprisal or opportunistic violence.
