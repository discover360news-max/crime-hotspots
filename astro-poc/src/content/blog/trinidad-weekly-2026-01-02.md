## Executive Summary

The report period between **December 27, 2025, and January 2, 2026,** saw a recorded total of **7 criminal incidents** across Trinidad and Tobago. Following a week of zero reported activity, the most significant trend this week is the sharp emergence of violent crime, specifically involving firearms. Port of Spain remains the primary area of concern, accounting for the highest concentration of incidents during this timeframe.

## Key Statistics

- **Total Incidents:** 7
- **Murder:** 2 incidents
- **Shooting:** 3 incidents
- **Seizures:** 2 incidents
- **Burglary:** 1 incident

## Regional Breakdown

### Port of Spain

Port of Spain recorded two incidents this week, resulting in two victims. The most common crime reported was murder, which accounted for half of the activity in the capital. The presence of both a murder and a seizure incident indicates a high-intensity environment for law enforcement intervention and violent crime.

### Mendez

Mendez reported a single but high-impact shooting incident on January 1, 2026. This specific event resulted in two victims, the highest victim count for a single incident this week. This suggests a targeted or multi-victim engagement that warrants close monitoring by regional security forces.

### La Veronica

Activity in La Veronica was characterized by a single report of **burglary on New Year's Day**. While non-violent in nature compared to other regions, it represents the only reported property crime for the period. Residents should remain vigilant regarding home security during holiday transition periods.

### Palo Seco and Arima

Both Palo Seco and Arima recorded one incident each involving extreme violence. Palo Seco recorded a murder, while Arima recorded a shooting incident, both occurring on January 1. These statistics highlight a geographically dispersed pattern of violent crime occurring simultaneously across the island.

## Crime Type Analysis

### Shooting

Shootings were the most prevalent crime type this week, with **3 incidents involving 3 victims**. This represents a significant surge from the previous week's zero reports. The data shows these incidents are not localized to one specific district but are spread across Mendez, Arima, and other areas, indicating a widespread issue with firearm-related violence.

### Murder

There were **2 recorded murders this week**, occurring in Port of Spain and Palo Seco. Both incidents took place on January 1, suggesting a violent start to the new year. These incidents accounted for 25% of the total victim count for the week and reflect a high lethality rate in reported violent encounters.

## Trends and Insights
**New Year’s Day Surge:** All detailed sample incidents occurred on January 1, 2026. This indicates a high-density cluster of criminal activity coinciding with public holiday celebrations and late-night gatherings.

**Prevalence of Firearms:** Between shootings, murders, and seizures, 100% of the violent incidents and a significant portion of law enforcement activity involved firearms. The data highlights the ongoing challenge of illegal arms circulation.

**Geographic Dispersion:** While Port of Spain is the primary hotspot, crime was distributed across several regions including the deep south (Palo Seco) and the east (Arima). This suggests that holiday-related violence was a national rather than localized issue.

## Safety Recommendations

Based on this week's data, we recommend:

- Increased Vigilance in Port of Spain: Residents and visitors to the capital should exercise heightened awareness, particularly in areas known for high foot traffic where recent murders have occurred.

- Home Security Enhancements: Following the burglary in La Veronica, homeowners are encouraged to test alarm systems and ensure all entry points are secured, especially when leaving the home unattended.

- Avoid High-Risk Conflict Areas: Given the surge in shooting incidents, citizens are advised to avoid areas with known gang activity or frequent police presence, particularly during late-night hours.

- Support for Seizure Operations: Community members should continue to use anonymous hotlines to report suspected illegal firearm caches, as law enforcement seizures remain a critical tool in preventing further violent incidents.
