## Executive Summary

Trinidad recorded 45 incidents during the week of February 14-20, 2026, maintaining the same incident count as the previous week but with a significant shift in crime composition. Violent crimes—particularly robbery, assault, and shooting—experienced sharp increases, while theft declined substantially. Port of Spain emerged as the primary hotspot, accounting for one-third of all reported incidents.

## Key Statistics

- **Total Incidents:** 45 (no change from previous week)
- **Murder:** 3 incidents ↓ 40% (down from 5 last week)
- **Robbery:** 14 incidents ↑ 100% (up from 7 last week)
- **Assault:** 14 incidents ↑ 133% (up from 6 last week)
- **Shooting:** 14 incidents ↑ 180% (up from 5 last week)
- **Sexual Assault:** 4 incidents ↑ 300% (up from 1 last week)

## Regional Breakdown

### Port of Spain
Port of Spain dominated the weekly crime landscape with 15 incidents and 23 victims—representing 33% of all reported incidents. Assault was the most prevalent crime type with 6 incidents affecting 7 victims. The capital's concentration of commercial activity and population density continues to make it a high-risk area for multiple crime categories.

### San Juan
San Juan recorded 3 incidents with 3 victims. Sexual assault was documented in this area, reflecting the concerning upward trend in this crime category across the territory.

### San Fernando
Two incidents were reported in San Fernando, including one murder. The southern city's incident rate remains lower than Port of Spain but warrants continued monitoring.

### Point Fortin and Carapo
Point Fortin and Carapo each recorded 2 incidents. Point Fortin saw a robbery affecting 3 victims, while Carapo experienced a shooting incident with 2 victims, indicating violent crime activity in these traditionally lower-incident areas.

## Crime Type Analysis

### Robbery
Robbery incidents doubled this week, rising from 7 to 14 cases with 14 victims. This 100% increase represents one of the most concerning trends, with Port of Spain accounting for multiple incidents. Robbery remains a high-impact crime due to its direct victimization and potential for escalation.

### Assault and Shooting
Assault cases increased 133% (from 6 to 14 incidents), while shooting incidents surged 180% (from 5 to 14 cases). Together, these crimes affected 28 victims and represent a marked escalation in violent confrontations across the island. The parallel rise in both categories suggests possible gang-related activity or community tensions.

### Sexual Assault
Sexual assault cases quadrupled from 1 to 4 incidents—a 300% increase that demands immediate attention. Three of the four cases occurred in Port of Spain, indicating a geographic concentration that requires targeted intervention and victim support resources.

### Theft Decline
Theft incidents dropped significantly by 73% (from 15 to 4 cases), suggesting either improved prevention efforts or a shift in criminal activity toward more violent offenses rather than property crimes.

## Trends and Insights

1. **Violent Crime Concentration:** While total incident counts remained flat week-over-week, the composition shifted dramatically toward violent crimes. Robbery, assault, and shooting combined accounted for 42 of 45 incidents (93%), indicating a troubling escalation in crime severity.

2. **Port of Spain's Persistent Challenge:** With one-third of all incidents, Port of Spain requires enhanced police presence and community safety initiatives. The concentration of assault and sexual assault cases in the capital suggests localized crime patterns that may benefit from targeted intervention.

3. **Sexual Assault Spike:** The 300% increase in sexual assault cases is alarming and may indicate either increased reporting or a genuine surge in offenses. This trend requires immediate victim support resources and specialized investigation protocols.

4. **Murder Rate Improvement:** The 40% decrease in murders (from 5 to 3) represents a positive trend, though the overall violent crime picture remains concerning given increases in other categories.

## Safety Recommendations

- **Residents in Port of Spain:** Avoid traveling alone, especially during evening hours. Remain vigilant in commercial areas and use well-lit, populated routes.
- **General Public:** Be cautious of robbery situations—comply with demands and prioritize personal safety over possessions.
- **Community Members:** Report suspicious activity to local police; community vigilance supports prevention efforts.
- **Vulnerable Populations:** Sexual assault victims should seek immediate support from local authorities and victim assistance organizations.
- **Business Owners:** Implement security measures including CCTV, adequate lighting, and alarm systems to deter robbery and theft.
