Perform a full security sweep of your home's entry points and perimeter gates every night before 9 PM. Consistency in your routine ensures that human error — such as forgetting to bolt a back door or leave a porch light on — is minimized. Many home intrusions occur through unsecured windows or gates that were left open simply because the occupant assumed someone else had checked them. By setting a specific time for this task, you ensure the home is hardened before the late-night hours when activity on the street quietens down. While high-tech alarms are useful, the physical act of verifying every deadbolt and padlock is the most effective way to prevent unauthorized entry.

**Steps to follow:**

- Check all external doors, including those leading to the garage or laundry area, and engage deadbolts.
- Verify that all window latches are secure and that burglar proofing shows no signs of tampering.
- Ensure the main driveway gate is padlocked or that the electronic motor is fully engaged.
- Turn on exterior security lighting to eliminate shadows near doors and windows.
- Store car keys in a consistent, secure location away from the front door where they cannot be easily fished out.
