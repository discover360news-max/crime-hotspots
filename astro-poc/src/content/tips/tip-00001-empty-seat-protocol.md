Keep your front passenger seat completely clear of bags or valuables and ensure all doors are locked the moment you enter the vehicle. Carjackers often look for targets who appear distracted or those with reachable valuables on the seat, making an empty seat a less attractive prospect. By locking doors immediately, you eliminate the opportunity for someone to pull the door open while you are stationary at a red light or in slow-moving traffic. This simple habit creates a physical barrier and a psychological deterrent, signaling that you are an observant driver who is prepared. In the local context of heavy traffic and frequent stops, this baseline level of security is your first line of defense against opportunistic crime.

**Steps to follow:**

- Place all handbags, laptops, and groceries in the trunk or on the floor behind the driver's seat before starting the engine.
- Depress the door lock button as soon as you sit down, rather than waiting for the car to auto-lock when in motion.
- Survey the area around your vehicle before entering to ensure no one is loitering near the passenger side.
- Maintain this protocol even for short trips to the pharmacy or grocery store where you might feel a false sense of security.
