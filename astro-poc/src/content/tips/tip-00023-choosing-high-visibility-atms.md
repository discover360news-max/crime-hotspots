Prioritize using ATMs located inside the main mall building or within high-traffic bank foyers rather than standalone or drive-through machines. Internal machines benefit from the mall's overall security presence, higher foot traffic, and better lighting, all of which act as natural deterrents to criminals. Drive-through or exterior machines are often more isolated, making it easier for someone to approach your window or wait in the shadows nearby without being noticed. When you use a machine in a busy area, the "eyes on the street" principle helps protect you, as criminals are less likely to attempt a robbery where they are easily seen and recorded by multiple cameras.

**Steps to follow:**

- Plan your withdrawals for times when the mall is active and security guards are visible.
- Avoid using machines located in quiet corridors or near secondary mall exits.
- If a machine looks tampered with or has an "Out of Service" sign taped over the screen, move to a different location.
- Have your card ready in your hand before you reach the machine to minimize time spent standing in front of it.
