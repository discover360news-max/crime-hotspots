Break all predictable patterns when transporting cash from a business to the bank by changing the time, the route, and the person responsible for the run. Criminals often conduct surveillance on businesses to identify "easy" habits, such as the manager leaving every Friday at 10 AM with a specific bag. By introducing randomness into your routine, you make it significantly harder for anyone to plan a robbery. Security is found in unpredictability. If a potential thief cannot guarantee when or how the cash will move, the risk of getting caught increases, and your business becomes a much less desirable target.

**Steps to follow:**

- Use non-descript bags, like a common grocery bag or an old backpack, to transport cash instead of a visible "bank bag."
- Avoid wearing a company uniform or branded clothing during the deposit run.
- If possible, use two people for the trip — one to drive and stay in the car, and one to enter the bank.
- Never discuss the timing of deposits in public areas or on social media.
