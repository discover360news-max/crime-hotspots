If you are ordered at gunpoint to drive or to enter a vehicle, comply calmly and do not resist — your priority is to stay unharmed and create an opportunity to escape or signal for help. Express kidnappings in Port of Spain often last under two hours and target victims for quick financial gain such as forced ATM withdrawals. Resistance at the point of initial contact significantly increases the risk of violence. Your best window to signal for help is when the vehicle stops — at a petrol station, ATM, or traffic checkpoint — not during the abduction itself. Remain calm, observe details, and communicate as little sensitive information as possible.

**Steps to follow:**

- Do not fight back at the moment of abduction; comply to reduce immediate risk of harm.
- Memorize identifying details about your captors — clothing, accents, vehicle type or color.
- At any public stop (petrol station, ATM, toll booth), make subtle eye contact with staff or other drivers to signal distress.
- If taken to an ATM, withdraw only the minimum requested — do not volunteer extra card details or PINs.
- Once released or escaped, call the police immediately and do not return to your home alone.
