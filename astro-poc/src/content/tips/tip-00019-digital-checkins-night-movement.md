Share your live location via WhatsApp or a similar app with a trusted friend or family member before you start walking alone at night. This digital tether ensures that someone knows exactly where you are and can track your progress in real-time until you reach your destination. If your movement stops unexpectedly or you veer off your intended path, your contact can take immediate action. This is a powerful deterrent and a safety net that bridges the gap between being alone and having support. Knowing that you are being monitored also encourages you to stay on well-lit, main roads rather than taking shortcuts through isolated areas.

**Steps to follow:**

- Use the "Live Location" feature for a set duration (e.g., 1 hour) rather than sending a one-time static location.
- Send a brief message to your contact confirming your expected arrival time.
- Keep your phone in your hand or a reachable pocket, but stay aware of your physical surroundings.
- Call or message the person the moment you are safely inside your destination to end the tracking.
