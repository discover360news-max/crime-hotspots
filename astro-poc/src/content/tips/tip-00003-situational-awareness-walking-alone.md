Keep at least one earbud out and your mobile phone stored away while walking on public streets or waiting for transport. Maintaining full use of your senses allows you to detect approaching footsteps or vehicles before they are within your personal space. When your attention is split between a screen and the pavement, your reaction time is significantly diminished, making you an easier target for phone-snatching or bag-grabbing. In Trinidad and Tobago, where street layouts can involve narrow sidewalks and sudden corners, being able to hear your environment is just as important as being able to see it. Visible jewellery and high-end electronics act as beacons; keeping them hidden helps you move through public spaces without drawing unnecessary attention.

**Steps to follow:**

- Store your phone in a front pocket or an inner bag compartment rather than holding it in your hand.
- Limit headphone use to a single ear or keep the volume low enough to hear ambient street noise.
- Walk with a purposeful gait and maintain a "head-up" posture to signal that you are alert.
- Avoid wearing flashy jewellery or large watches when walking in unfamiliar or isolated areas.
