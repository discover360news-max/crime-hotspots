Use your non-dominant hand to completely cover the keypad from above while entering your PIN with your other hand. This physical shield prevents "shoulder surfing" by bystanders and blocks the view of hidden micro-cameras that criminals sometimes install on or near the machine. Even if you believe you are alone in the ATM booth, the risk of technical skimming remains high. A PIN is useless to a criminal without the physical card, but if they have already skimmed your card data, the PIN is the final piece they need to drain your account. This habit should be applied at every point-of-sale terminal and Linx machine, as it is a zero-cost way to protect your financial security.

**Steps to follow:**

- Approach the machine and check for any loose parts or sticky residue on the card slot.
- Position your body directly in front of the keypad to block the line of sight from behind.
- Cup your hand over the keypad like a roof, ensuring no angle is left open for a camera to see.
- Memorize your PIN rather than writing it down or storing it in your phone's contacts.
