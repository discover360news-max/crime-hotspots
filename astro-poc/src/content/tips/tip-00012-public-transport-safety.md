On maxi taxis and PTSC buses, keep your bag on your lap with the zipper facing you, and choose a seat near the middle of the vehicle where you have visibility of both the door and the driver. Public transport is a high-density environment where opportunistic theft is easiest when passengers are distracted or seated near the exit doors. Phones left on laps or placed on the seat beside you are particularly vulnerable to snatching at stops when doors open. Staying alert during boarding and alighting — the two moments of greatest exposure — is more protective than any physical security measure.

**Steps to follow:**

- Place your bag on your lap and hold it with both hands when the vehicle is approaching a stop.
- Avoid using your phone visibly unless the vehicle is moving and away from stops.
- Sit away from the sliding door if the vehicle is not full, to reduce snatch-and-run exposure.
- If travelling at night, use well-known, busy routes and avoid the last maxi of the evening on quieter corridors.
- Note the route number and maxi license plate when boarding — useful if you need to report an incident.
