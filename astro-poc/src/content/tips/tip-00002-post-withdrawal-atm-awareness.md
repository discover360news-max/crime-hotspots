Secure your cash inside your wallet or pocket before leaving the ATM enclosure and avoid counting money in the open air. Publicly displaying cash identifies you as a high-value target to anyone watching the machine from a distance or a parked car. Criminals typically wait for the moment of greatest vulnerability, which is when a person is distracted by handling their notes or receipt. By moving away from the machine quickly and keeping your funds concealed, you reduce the window of opportunity for a robbery. In busy commercial hubs, the goal is to blend back into the crowd as an unremarkable pedestrian who is not carrying visible wealth.

**Steps to follow:**

- Collect your cash and card immediately and place them directly into a secure pocket or zippered bag.
- Take your receipt with you to review later in a private, secure location rather than standing at the machine.
- Scan the immediate vicinity for anyone lingering without a clear purpose before exiting the ATM booth.
- Walk toward a well-lit area with high foot traffic immediately after completing your transaction.
- If you feel you are being followed after a withdrawal, enter a busy store or approach a security guard.
