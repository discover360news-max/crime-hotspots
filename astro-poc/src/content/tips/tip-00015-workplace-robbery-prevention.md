If your business handles daily cash, vary the time, route, and person responsible for making bank deposits — never follow the same pattern two days in a row. Workplace robbery is most often preceded by surveillance, where criminals observe a predictable routine over several days before striking. A consistent schedule — same time, same route, same employee — makes your operation an easy target. Randomizing these variables removes the predictability that makes the risk calculation favorable for a would-be robber. This applies equally to small shops, market vendors, and larger businesses.

**Steps to follow:**

- Rotate the staff member responsible for deposits across different days where possible.
- Vary the departure time for deposits — avoid the same window each day (e.g., always at 3 PM closing).
- Use different routes to the bank, even if some are slightly longer.
- Use an inconspicuous bag rather than a branded money bag or deposit envelope visible to the public.
- Consider a cash management service or night safe option if daily deposits represent significant sums.
