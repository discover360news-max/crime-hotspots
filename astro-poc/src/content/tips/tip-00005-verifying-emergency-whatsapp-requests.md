Never transfer funds or provide personal information to anyone on WhatsApp claiming to be a relative in distress without speaking to them directly over a standard voice call. Scammers often hijack accounts or use "spoofed" numbers to impersonate family members, claiming they have lost their phone or are in a legal or medical emergency. This tactic relies on creating a sense of urgency to bypass your critical thinking. By insisting on a direct conversation, you can easily verify the person's identity through their voice or by asking a specific question only they would know. Digital communication is easily faked, but a real-time voice verification is much harder for a fraudster to bypass.

**Steps to follow:**

- Stop and breathe if you receive an urgent message asking for money; scammers rely on your panic.
- Attempt to call the relative on their known, original phone number first.
- Ask the person a "challenge question" about a shared family memory that is not available on social media.
- Report the suspicious number to WhatsApp and block the contact immediately.
- Inform other family members about the scam attempt to prevent them from being targeted.
