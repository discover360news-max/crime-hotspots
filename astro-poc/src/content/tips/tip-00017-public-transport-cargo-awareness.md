Sit in a position where you have a clear view of the door and keep all personal bags on your lap with your arms looped through the straps. On maxi taxis and buses, placing items in the overhead rack or on the floor near your feet makes them easy targets for "snatch and grab" thefts as someone exits the vehicle. Keeping your belongings in your immediate physical control ensures that you can feel any attempt to move them. Furthermore, being able to see who enters and exits the vehicle allows you to stay aware of the people around you and spot any suspicious behavior before the vehicle reaches your stop.

**Steps to follow:**

- Choose a seat toward the middle or front of the maxi taxi where you are visible to the driver.
- Avoid using your phone or sleeping while in transit, as these are peak times for opportunistic theft.
- If the vehicle feels unsafe or if individuals enter who make you uncomfortable, do not hesitate to exit at the next well-lit stop.
- Keep your fare ready in your hand or a reachable pocket to avoid opening your main wallet or bag in the vehicle.
