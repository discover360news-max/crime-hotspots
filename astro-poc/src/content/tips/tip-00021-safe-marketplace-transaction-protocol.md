Conduct all Facebook Marketplace or online classified transactions in highly public, well-lit areas, and always bring a companion with you. Meeting a stranger at a private residence or an isolated location significantly increases the risk of robbery or physical harm. Busy locations like mall parking lots (near cameras) or areas outside police stations are ideal because they deter criminal behavior through high visibility. Bringing a second person provides an extra set of eyes and ensures you are not outnumbered if the "buyer" or "seller" brings others. This protocol changes the dynamic from a vulnerable one-on-one meeting to a secure, public exchange.

**Steps to follow:**

- Suggest a specific, busy meeting point such as a major gas station or a mall atrium.
- Conduct transactions during daylight hours only.
- Inspect the item and complete the cash exchange quickly; avoid lingering once the deal is done.
- If the other party insists on changing the location to somewhere private at the last minute, cancel the transaction.
