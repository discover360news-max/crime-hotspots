When you arrive at a fete, concert, or outdoor event, identify the two nearest exits before the crowd builds and position yourself within reasonable reach of one throughout the night. Altercations at large events often escalate quickly, and the risk is compounded when exits are blocked by dense crowds. Knowing your route out in advance — rather than looking for it under pressure — significantly reduces the time it takes to leave a dangerous situation. This is especially relevant at outdoor events where perimeter fencing can limit escape options. Staying aware of your surroundings does not mean being anxious; it means being ready.

**Steps to follow:**

- On arrival, walk the perimeter and locate at least two exit points before heading to the main area.
- Avoid positioning yourself deep in the crowd near the stage if tension is rising or the crowd is unusually dense.
- Keep your group together and agree on a meeting point outside the venue if you get separated.
- Limit alcohol intake enough to stay aware of your environment and capable of quick movement.
- If you witness an altercation forming nearby, move away from it immediately — do not watch or film from close range.
