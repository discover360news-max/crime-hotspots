When stopping at red lights or in heavy traffic, leave enough space to see the rear tires of the car in front of you. This distance, roughly one car length, provides the necessary "escape room" to maneuver your vehicle out of the lane if you are approached by someone suspicious. If you are bumper-to-bumper, you are effectively trapped and cannot drive away without reversing — a move that is often blocked by the car behind you. In Port of Spain's urban grid, where intersections can be hotspots for opportunistic crime, this tactical positioning is a proactive way to maintain mobility. Being able to quickly steer around an obstacle can be the difference between escaping a threat and being stuck in a vulnerable position.

**Steps to follow:**

- Stop the vehicle when you can still see the ground beneath the tires of the car ahead.
- Keep the car in gear (or "Drive") so you are ready to move instantly if needed.
- Monitor your side and rearview mirrors constantly while stationary at the light.
- If approached, use the gap to steer into an adjacent lane or onto the shoulder to exit the area.
