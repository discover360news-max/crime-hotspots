Perform a 360-degree scan of your street and nearby shadows before slowing down to enter your driveway, especially after dark. Driveway carjackings often occur in the few seconds it takes for an automatic gate to open or while a driver is exiting the car to manually unlock a gate. By checking your mirrors and looking for strange vehicles parked nearby, you can spot potential threats before you are "boxed in." If anything looks suspicious — such as a car idling with its lights off — continue driving past your home and circle the block or go to the nearest police station. Your car is a mobile safety bubble; only leave it when you are certain the immediate area is clear.

**Steps to follow:**

- Keep your windows up and doors locked as you approach your home.
- Use your high beams to illuminate the area around your gate and any bushes where someone could hide.
- Wait for the gate to fully open and for your car to be inside the property before putting the vehicle in "Park."
- Close the gate immediately behind you before exiting the vehicle to enter the house.
