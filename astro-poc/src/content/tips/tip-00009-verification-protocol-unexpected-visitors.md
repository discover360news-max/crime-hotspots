Communicate with any unexpected visitor through a closed door, intercom, or window, and never turn the lock until you have confirmed their identity and purpose. Criminals often use "soft" entry tactics, posing as delivery drivers, utility workers, or people in distress to trick residents into opening the door. Once the door is even slightly ajar, the physical advantage shifts to the intruder. In a residential setting, you have the right to deny entry to anyone you did not invite. Legitimate service providers in Trinidad and Tobago will have official ID and will not mind waiting or returning later if you need to call their office to verify their dispatch.

**Steps to follow:**

- Keep the secondary security gate or "burglar-proof" door locked even when the main wooden door is open for breeze.
- Ask for the person's name and the company they represent through the closed door.
- Look for a branded vehicle parked outside that matches their stated company.
- Call the company's official number (found via a search, not provided by the person) to confirm the appointment.
- If they claim it is an emergency, offer to call the police or an ambulance for them rather than letting them inside.
