Position your bags toward the front of your body and avoid leaving high-value shopping bags visible in your vehicle or while walking through the mall. Crowded shopping centers provide cover for pickpockets and thieves who look for distracted shoppers with loosely held belongings. When you carry bags containing electronics or expensive items, you signal that you have assets worth taking. By keeping your personal bag in front of you and consolidating smaller shopping bags into one non-descript tote, you reduce your profile as a lucrative target. This is especially important in large local malls where foot traffic is high and exits are numerous, allowing a thief to disappear quickly into the crowd.

**Steps to follow:**

- Use bags with cross-body straps and keep the zipper side facing your body.
- If you must store purchases in your car, place them in the trunk before you arrive at your next destination.
- Avoid hanging your purse or bag on the back of chairs in mall food courts.
- Stay aware of "distraction" techniques, such as someone bumping into you or spilling something nearby.
