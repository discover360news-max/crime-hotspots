Refrain from posting images of your national ID, passport, driver's permit, or any document containing personal numbers on social media. Even if you think you have blurred the sensitive parts, modern image enhancement software can often reconstruct the hidden text. Identity thieves use these images to open fraudulent accounts, apply for loans, or create fake personas that can implicate you in criminal activity. Your personal identification numbers are keys to your financial and legal life; once they are public, they cannot be retracted. Protecting your digital footprint is as essential as locking your physical mailbox to prevent fraud and long-term credit damage.

**Steps to follow:**

- If you must share a document for official purposes, use secure, encrypted email or official portals rather than social apps.
- Check your past "stories" and posts for any accidental exposure of mail, bills, or ID cards in the background.
- Review your privacy settings to ensure only trusted friends can see your personal details and history.
- Alert your bank immediately if you believe your personal data has been compromised online.
