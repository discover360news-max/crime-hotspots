Install a high-quality peephole or a video doorbell to identify visitors from a distance or through a screen without having to open your front door. Modern video doorbells allow you to see and speak to whoever is outside via your smartphone, even if you are not at home. This creates a powerful layer of defense because it removes the element of surprise that intruders rely on. If you cannot clearly identify the person or if they are acting suspiciously, you can simply refuse to answer or tell them to leave without ever exposing yourself to a physical threat. Simple visibility tools are often enough to make a potential intruder move on to a less prepared target.

**Steps to follow:**

- Mount the camera or peephole at an average adult's eye level for the best field of view.
- Ensure the area outside your door is well-lit so the camera can capture clear images at night.
- Use the two-way audio feature to ask visitors for identification before approaching the door.
- If a visitor refuses to show their face or ID to the camera, do not open the door and consider calling a neighbor or the police.
