If you are confronted by an armed individual and ordered to drive or enter a vehicle, comply with instructions calmly and avoid sudden movements. The primary goal in the initial moments of an express kidnapping or carjacking is to preserve your life and avoid escalating the situation to physical violence. Most perpetrators are motivated by the asset or a quick cash withdrawal and are looking for the path of least resistance. By appearing compliant, you lower the tension and may gain opportunities to signal for help later in a more controlled environment, such as a petrol station or a well-lit junction. Your safety is always more valuable than the vehicle or the cash in your account.

**Steps to follow:**

- Keep your hands visible at all times and announce your movements before making them (e.g., "I am reaching for my seatbelt").
- Avoid making direct, prolonged eye contact, which can be perceived as a challenge or an attempt to memorize features.
- If forced to go to an ATM, withdraw the amount requested without resistance.
- Look for opportunities to leave a signal or attract attention at traffic stops where police or security may be present.
