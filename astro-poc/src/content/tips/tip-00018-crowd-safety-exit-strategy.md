Upon arriving at a fete, concert, or large public event, immediately identify two distinct ways to exit the venue. In large crowds, exits can become blocked or bottle-necked during an emergency or if a fight breaks out. Knowing an alternative route — other than the main gate you entered through — can save critical seconds if you need to leave quickly. Crowds in high-energy environments like Carnival fetes can shift rapidly; staying toward the perimeter or near your identified exits allows you to maintain personal space and a clear path to safety. Practical awareness of your surroundings ensures you can enjoy the event while remaining prepared for a change in atmosphere.

**Steps to follow:**

- Walk the perimeter of the area when you arrive to locate side gates or emergency exits.
- Establish a "meet-up point" with your group in case you get separated and phone signals are jammed.
- Pay attention to the "vibe" of the crowd; if you notice increasing aggression or pushing, move toward the exit immediately.
- Avoid the very center of dense crowds where movement is restricted and exits are hardest to reach.
