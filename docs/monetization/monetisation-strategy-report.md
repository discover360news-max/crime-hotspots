# CrimeHotSpots.com — Monetisation & Growth Strategy Report
**Prepared:** February 2026
**Owner:** Kavell Forde, Trinidad & Tobago
**Status:** Pre-revenue, pre-institutional, early-audience platform
**Traffic baseline (last 28 days, updated Feb 25 2026):** ~18 organic clicks/day (GSC, most reliable), ~82 page views/day (GA4), ~119 unique users over 28 days by GA4 cookie tracking (undercounts — GSC is more reliable). 8,410 impressions/month at position 7.5, CTR 5.9%. Real daily visitor count is approximately 18–25.

---

## Executive Summary

CrimeHotSpots.com is a technically solid, genuinely useful platform sitting at the very start of its commercial journey. With approximately 18–25 real visitors per day (GSC is the more reliable signal at ~18 organic clicks/day; GA4 undercounts due to ad blockers and cookie consent), a dormant newsletter, and no institutional relationships yet, the honest assessment is this: the platform is early for most monetisation models, but meaningfully further along than it might appear. The first 6–12 months of work must be primarily focused on audience growth and activation, not revenue extraction.

That is not a failure — it is the correct reading of the situation. The data asset is real and unique. The automated pipeline is working. The operational costs are low enough ($50–200/month) that the platform is not under financial pressure. There is time to build properly.

The path to funding growth looks like this: grow the free audience first, activate the newsletter as a trust-building channel, make one or two strategic institutional approaches once the site has credible traffic and data depth, and layer in grant funding as a medium-term capital injection to accelerate Caribbean expansion. Revenue before 2027 should be measured in covering costs, not generating surplus.

**The top 3 priorities are:**

1. **Build the audience to 100–200 visitors/day before attempting most monetisation.** At ~18–25 visitors/day the platform is further along than the original estimate, but institutional buyers and grant committees want to see consistent, demonstrable traction. The organic search foundation is strong (position 7.5, 5.9% CTR, 300 impressions/day) — this is the lever to pull.

2. **Activate the newsletter now, even with 0–50 subscribers.** A consistent weekly send establishes the habit, builds the asset, and creates a demonstrated track record that institutional buyers and grant applications will ask for.

3. **Start a documented outreach log to one target segment — the insurance sector — within 6 months.** Not to close a deal, but to learn what they actually need, build a relationship, and position for a genuine institutional conversation once data depth reaches 2+ years.

Everything else in this report supports these three priorities.

## Section 1: Data Asset Audit

### Asset Overview Table

| Asset | Uniqueness in Caribbean | Public Value | Commercial Value | Key Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Raw incident data / CSV export | Very high — no equivalent public dataset | High | Medium-High | 1.5 years limits actuarial use |
| Statistics by area | High — no granular area-level public source | High | Medium | Needs 2+ years for trend credibility |
| Statistics by crime type | Medium — TTPS publishes aggregates | High | Medium | Annual TTPS data provides rough benchmark |
| Week-over-week trends | High — no near-real-time equivalent | Medium | Medium | Requires sustained traffic to demonstrate utility |
| Unreported crime data (Facebook) | Unique — exists nowhere else | High | High (conditional) | Ethical constraints limit commercial use of raw data |
| Historical comparisons | Low-Medium currently | Medium | Low currently | 1.5 years is insufficient for serious longitudinal work |

---

### Asset 1: Raw Incident Data / CSV Export

Individual crime events with location, type, date, and source URL, collected via automated RSS pipeline and manual Facebook entry. Each row is a discrete incident.

**Uniqueness:** No equivalent public dataset exists in Trinidad & Tobago or the broader Caribbean. TTPS publishes annual aggregate counts. Newspapers publish articles. Nobody publishes incident-level structured data.

**Public Value: High.** Citizens, journalists, and community groups can use this to understand what is happening where and when. The granularity is what makes it useful.

**Commercial Value: Medium-High.** For insurance actuaries, risk consultants, and property developers, incident-level geospatial data is exactly what they want. The limitation is depth — 1.5 years is workable for short-term risk assessment but not for multi-year actuarial modelling. At 3+ years, this asset becomes significantly more valuable.

**Limitation note:** At 1.5 years, the raw data can support current-state risk snapshots. It cannot yet support premium/claims correlation studies or multi-cycle trend analysis.

---

### Asset 2: Statistics by Area

Pre-aggregated crime counts, rates, and trends broken down by geographic area (district/community level).

**Uniqueness:** High. TTPS does not publish area-level breakdowns in accessible form. The TTPS annual report gives national and divisional totals, not community granularity.

**Public Value: High.** This is the most immediately useful asset for concerned citizens making housing, travel, or safety decisions. It is also the most shareable and the most likely to drive organic traffic growth.

**Commercial Value: Medium.** For insurers and businesses, area-level statistics are directly usable for property risk banding and site assessments. The commercial value grows significantly once data depth allows trend comparisons (area X is improving, area Y is deteriorating).

**Limitation note:** Area statistics become most commercially valuable when paired with demographic and property data — a future integration opportunity with TT census data.

---

### Asset 3: Statistics by Crime Type

Breakdown of incidents by category: murder, robbery, assault, kidnapping, sexual offences, and others.

**Uniqueness:** Medium. TTPS does publish type-level aggregates annually. The differentiation here is recency (near-real-time vs annual), granularity (by area not just national), and the inclusion of unreported incidents.

**Public Value: High.** Crime type breakdowns help the public understand the nature of risk in their area, which is qualitatively different from knowing raw crime counts.

**Commercial Value: Medium.** For commercial underwriters, crime type data matters significantly — a neighbourhood with high burglary rates has different property insurance implications than one with high violent crime. This asset is commercially valuable in combination with area data.

**Limitation note:** Some crime type categories currently have low incident counts, which limits statistical significance. As data volume grows this improves.

---

### Asset 4: Week-over-Week Trends

Short-term temporal patterns — are crime levels rising or falling compared to the previous week and month?

**Uniqueness:** High. No other source provides this cadence for TT crime data.

**Public Value: Medium.** Genuinely useful for citizens and journalists but requires regular engagement to convert to habitual use. This is the core hook for a weekly newsletter product.

**Commercial Value: Medium.** Security firms, corporate security managers, and event organisers have genuine use for short-term trend data. Not the highest-value commercial asset on its own, but it is what drives repeat platform visits and newsletter retention.

**Limitation note:** Week-over-week trends become more interpretable once seasonal baselines are established, which requires at least 2 full years of data.

---

### Asset 5: Unreported Crime Data (Facebook-Sourced, Manually Curated)

Crimes reported in TT community Facebook groups that never appear in newspaper RSS feeds. Manually entered by the owner after reading community posts. Captures a layer of actual crime activity invisible to all other data sources.

**Uniqueness:** Completely unique. No other platform captures this. No academic study, government report, or news aggregator has this data.

**Public Value: High.** The gap between reported and actual crime is a well-documented criminological problem. Making that gap visible — even approximately — is genuine public value.

**Commercial Value: High (conditional on ethical framing).** Aggregate insights derived from this data (e.g. "unreported incidents in area X represent approximately 40% of total estimated crime activity") are commercially valuable to insurers and risk assessors who know that reported crime statistics systematically undercount. However, the commercial use of this data is subject to significant ethical constraints addressed in Section 4.

**Limitation note:** The sustainability of this asset depends entirely on the owner's continued manual effort. It does not scale automatically.

---

### Asset 6: Historical Comparisons

Year-on-year comparisons of crime trends, currently limited to approximately 18 months of data (mid-2024 to early 2026).

**Uniqueness:** Low-Medium currently. With limited depth, comparisons are possible but thin.

**Public Value: Medium.** One full year of comparison is useful — citizens can understand whether this year is worse or better than last. But it lacks the weight of multi-year trend analysis.

**Commercial Value: Low currently, High at 5 years.** Actuarial credibility, academic citation, and development bank interest all require multi-year longitudinal datasets. At 1.5 years, this asset is nascent. At 5 years it becomes the platform's most durable commercial differentiator.

**Limitation note:** The fastest way to address this is to extend backwards using existing public sources (addressed in Section 6).

---

## Section 2: Audience Value Mapping

### Segment 1: General Public / Concerned Citizens

**What they need:** Simple, clear answers to "is my area safe?", "what types of crime should I be aware of?", and "is crime getting better or worse near me?"

**How they currently get this:** News articles (fragmented, not searchable, not aggregated), word of mouth, Facebook community groups (unstructured). There is no single resource in TT that answers these questions reliably.

**What makes CrimeHotSpots indispensable:** The area-level dashboard and crime detail pages already do this. The gap to fill is discoverability — the platform needs to be the first result when someone searches "crime in [area] Trinidad."

**Would they pay?** No. This segment expects free access and any paywall will simply push them back to Facebook groups. They are not a revenue source — they are the audience that makes everything else viable.

**Revenue potential at current baseline (~20/day):** Zero directly. The public audience does not generate revenue — it generates credibility. At 100/day: still zero direct revenue from this segment, but it is the foundation for newsletter growth, media citations, and institutional trust.

---

### Segment 2: Caribbean Diaspora

**What they need:** Reliable information about safety conditions in TT for family decision-making — planning visits, assessing whether to return, property investment decisions, supporting family members.

**How they currently get this:** Calling family, following TT news Facebook pages, reading newspaper articles. No structured resource exists for diaspora audiences.

**What makes CrimeHotSpots indispensable:** A clean, trustworthy dashboard that answers "how dangerous is [area] right now" without requiring local knowledge to interpret. The diaspora audience is underserved and highly motivated — they have both urgency and emotional investment.

**Would they pay?** Potentially for a premium newsletter with curated safety analysis. A "Diaspora Safety Brief" — monthly, $5–10/month — is conceivable once the subscriber list reaches 500+. Currently, this is a medium-term play.

**Revenue potential at current baseline (~20/day):** Near zero directly, but diaspora visitors are disproportionately engaged (high page views per session suggests people checking on family/areas). At 100/day with newsletter activated: potentially $50–200/month from diaspora paid newsletter subscriptions, assuming 3–5% conversion from a growing free list. This segment is the most likely to donate via Ko-fi unprompted.

---

### Segment 3: Journalists and Media

**What they need:** Verified incident data to corroborate or expand news stories, trend data to support investigative pieces, quick area-level context for breaking crime coverage.

**How they currently get this:** Calling TTPS press office (slow, limited), their own reporter notes, other journalists. There is no structured data resource for TT journalism.

**What makes CrimeHotSpots indispensable:** A citable, structured data source that journalists can reference and link to. If CrimeHotSpots becomes the recognised source for TT crime data, media citations drive organic SEO traffic — this is a distribution channel, not a revenue channel.

**Would they pay?** Individual journalists, no. Media organisations, possibly for data partnerships or custom briefings, but this requires a relationship and a track record. Not a near-term revenue source.

**Revenue potential:** Low directly. High indirectly — media citations are the fastest credibility builder for institutional outreach.

---

### Segment 4: Insurance Sector

**What they need:** Geographic crime risk data for property insurance pricing, commercial underwriting decisions, reinsurance risk modelling, and portfolio loss assessment.

**How they currently get this:** Caribbean actuaries have extremely limited local data. They rely primarily on TTPS annual aggregate statistics (published late, national-level only), regional indices like the Global Crime Index (survey-based, not incident-level), and professional judgment. The data gap is well-known in the industry. Underwriters at carriers like Sagicor, COLFIRE, Guardian General Insurance, and Beacon Insurance use a combination of claims experience and crude geographic banding — not granular incident data.

**The specific gap:** Caribbean property insurers want to know: which postcodes or communities have meaningfully higher burglary or robbery rates, and is that rate improving or deteriorating? CrimeHotSpots is the only source that could answer this at the community level for TT.

**What makes CrimeHotSpots indispensable:** Area-level crime rates by type, updated regularly, with year-on-year trend direction. An insurer does not need real-time incident data — they need reliable aggregated statistics at the geographic unit of their portfolio risk bands. A quarterly area crime report, packaged and delivered, could serve this need directly.

**Would they pay?** Yes — but the pricing must be calibrated to the Caribbean market. A TT insurer is not a Lloyd's syndicate. Realistic institutional pricing for a TT carrier:
- Basic data package (quarterly area statistics PDF + CSV): $200–500/quarter
- Ongoing data subscription (monthly area updates): $150–300/month
- Custom analysis report (specific area deep-dive): $500–1,000 one-off

At 3–5 Caribbean insurer clients, this covers operational costs and begins funding expansion. This is the most realistic path to first revenue, but it requires the data to be at least 2 years deep and requires active outreach.

**Revenue potential at current baseline (~20/day):** Zero — traffic is largely irrelevant to this segment. Insurance actuaries care about data quality, geographic granularity, update frequency, and contractual reliability. Revenue potential is driven entirely by outreach and data depth, not web traffic.
**Revenue potential at 2 years of data + active outreach:** $500–2,000/month if 2–4 institutional clients are secured.

---

### Segment 5: Businesses Assessing Operational Risk

**What they need:** Site selection decisions (office locations, retail outlets, distribution hubs), employee security briefings, insurance broker requirements, due diligence for foreign investors.

**How they currently get this:** Security consultants (expensive, ad hoc), news monitoring, word of mouth. No structured resource exists.

**What makes CrimeHotSpots indispensable:** A self-service area risk assessment tool — type in an area, get a crime profile. This is already partially live via the dashboard and area pages.

**Would they pay?** Individual businesses could pay for custom risk reports (one-off $500–1,500). Law firms handling investment due diligence, security consultancies, and multinational employers are realistic targets. Foreign investors and diaspora-owned businesses planning TT operations are a specific niche.

**Revenue potential at current baseline (~20/day):** Zero for unsolicited business. At 75–100/day with established track record and active outreach: $200–800/month from custom risk report commissions if marketed directly to TT businesses and international companies with TT operations.

---

## Section 3: Monetisation Model Analysis

### Model A: Completely Free with Community Support (Ko-fi, Donations)

**Description:** Platform remains entirely free. Revenue comes from voluntary Ko-fi donations from users who find value in the platform.

**Honest math at ~20 visitors/day:** Assuming 0.5% donation conversion and a $5 average donation, 20 visitors/day yields approximately $0.30/day — or roughly $9/month. At 100/day the same math gives ~$45/month. Neither figure covers operational costs. The Ko-fi account exists and is visible but community support cannot be a meaningful revenue source until traffic is 5–10x higher and the platform has an emotionally invested regular audience (typically built through a consistent newsletter, not just web visits).

**What audience size is needed?**
- $100/month: approximately 650 daily visitors at 0.5% conversion ($5 average)
- $500/month: approximately 3,200 daily visitors
- These thresholds are far beyond the current trajectory for the 6-month horizon

**Verdict: Not viable now. Viable later as a supplementary channel only, never as primary funding.** Community support donations are meaningful at 500+ daily visitors, not at 4. Do not depend on this model to fund anything.

---

### Model B: Free Public Tier, Paid Institutional API/Data Tier

**Description:** All public-facing pages, dashboards, and crime detail pages remain permanently free. A separate institutional tier provides raw CSV batch exports, structured API access, custom area reports, and historical data packages for insurers, risk consultants, and researchers.

**Free tier (always):** Everything currently on the site — dashboard, crime pages, area profiles, blog, headlines, weekly blog posts.

**Institutional tier examples:**
- Bulk CSV export (full dataset, quarterly update): $200–400/quarter
- API endpoint (authenticated, rate-limited, real-time): $150–300/month
- Custom area analysis report: $500–1,000 one-off
- Annual data licence (insurer portfolio pricing): $1,200–3,600/year

**Revenue projection at current baseline:** Zero. There are no institutional clients and no outreach has occurred.

**Revenue projection at 100 visitors/day with 2 years of data and active outreach:** Realistically 1–3 institutional clients generating $300–900/month if approached directly. This is the most commercially promising model but requires a clear runway to execute.

**The cold outreach reality:** With zero institutional interest and 2–5 hours/week bandwidth, the realistic path to first institutional client is: (1) spend one month preparing a professional one-page data capability sheet, (2) identify 5–8 specific contacts at Sagicor General, COLFIRE, Guardian General, Beacon, and two TT-based risk consultancies, (3) send cold email, (4) expect 3–6 month lead time to any paying engagement. This is achievable but requires dedicated monthly time allocation even at low bandwidth.

**Verdict: Not viable now, viable in 12–18 months.** The data needs to reach 2+ years and the outreach needs to begin now so relationships are warm when the data is ready.

---

### Model C: Free Site, Paid Newsletter Tiers

**Description:** Free weekly newsletter summarising TT crime trends. Paid tier ($5–15/month) offers deeper analysis, area-specific briefings, or early data access.

**Current state:** Newsletter is dormant. 0–50 subscribers. No sends have gone out.

**Free tier content:** Weekly crime summary (total incidents, top areas, notable cases). Essentially what the weekly automated blog already produces.

**Paid tier content that justifies $5–15/month:** Area-specific monthly briefings (a deep-dive on one community each month), quarterly trend analysis report, early access to annual summary, diaspora-specific safety guide (formatted for non-TT readers).

**Subscriber growth math:** Starting from zero active sends, building to 500 free subscribers in 12 months requires consistent weekly sends plus SEO traffic growth and one or two high-visibility moments (media citation, Reddit post traction). This is achievable but not guaranteed. Getting to 50 paid subscribers from a 500-subscriber free list (10% conversion at $10/month) generates $500/month — enough to cover operational costs.

**Timeline:** 18–24 months to reach a point where newsletter revenue meaningfully covers costs, assuming weekly sends start now and SEO compounds.

**Revenue ceiling:** At TT-focused scale, newsletter revenue probably plateaus at $300–800/month without expansion to other islands. It is a cost-coverage model, not a growth-funding model.

**Verdict: Viable later, but only if the newsletter is activated immediately.** Every month of dormancy is lost compounding. Start sending now, even to 10 subscribers.

---

### Model D: Grant and NGO Funding

**Description:** Apply for project grants from Caribbean development institutions, international NGOs, or journalism/data transparency foundations to fund platform expansion.

**Realistic options accessible from Trinidad & Tobago:**

| Funder | Programme relevance | Grant range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) | Public safety, governance, data | $10,000–50,000 | Requires institutional track record or NGO/company registration |
| Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) | Crime prevention, data transparency | $15,000–75,000 | Highly competitive, requires structured proposal |
| UNDP Caribbean | Crime data, public safety, resilience | $5,000–25,000 | More accessible for emerging projects; TT country office is reachable |
| USAID Eastern Caribbean | Crime and justice programmes | $10,000–50,000 | Focused on specific programme areas; requires alignment with current priorities |
| Open Society Foundations | Data journalism, transparency | $10,000–30,000 | Strong fit with mission; applications competitive globally |
| Knight Foundation | Data journalism innovation | $10,000–50,000 | US-focused but has Caribbean-relevant programmes |

**Legal entity requirement:** Most institutional grants require either a registered company or an NGO/charitable entity. A sole-trader or individual is typically ineligible. Registering a company in TT (a limited liability company) is the minimum step — registration via the Companies Registry, cost approximately TTD 1,000–2,000 and 2–4 weeks.

**Bandwidth reality:** Grant applications take 20–40 hours to prepare properly. Grant reporting (if successful) takes 5–10 hours/quarter. This is significant overhead against a 2–5 hour/week budget. For a first application, target smaller, simpler grants (UNDP, Open Society) before attempting CDB or IDB.

**Pros:** Non-dilutive capital, no revenue pressure, aligns with public-interest mission, provides credibility signal.

**Cons:** Highly competitive, slow (6–18 month cycle from application to funding), requires legal entity setup, reporting burden is real, success rate for first-time applicants is low.

**Verdict: Viable medium-term, but requires legal entity registration first and one focused application per year given bandwidth constraints.** Start with UNDP Caribbean as the most accessible entry point.

---

### Model E: Mixed Approach (Recommended)

**The optimal combination given the constraints:**

**Phase 1 (0–6 months): Foundation — zero revenue pressure**
- Activate newsletter immediately. Send weekly. Build the habit.
- The organic search foundation is already strong (position 7.5, 5.9% CTR, 300 impressions/day). Focus on growing from ~20 to 100+ visitors/day by improving average position and expanding content to capture more search queries.
- Register a TT company (low cost, enables future grant applications and institutional contracts).
- Prepare a one-page data capability document for eventual insurance sector outreach.

**Phase 2 (6–18 months): First revenue signals**
- Newsletter reaches 200+ subscribers. Introduce paid tier at $8/month. Target: 10–20 paid subscribers ($80–160/month).
- Make first institutional outreach to 3–5 TT insurers and risk consultancies. No expectation of immediate revenue — relationship building only.
- Submit one grant application (UNDP Caribbean or Open Society). Regardless of outcome, the process forces a clear articulation of the platform's value proposition.

**Phase 3 (18–36 months): Sustainable funding for expansion**
- 1–2 institutional data clients generating $300–800/month.
- Newsletter generating $200–500/month.
- Grant funding ($15,000–30,000 one-off) funds second island expansion.
- Ko-fi / community donations as a background supplementary channel ($50–100/month at scale).

**How the models reinforce each other:** Newsletter growth provides proof of engaged audience for grant applications. Institutional outreach relationships inform what data features to build. Grant capital funds the expansion that grows the commercial dataset. Traffic growth from SEO makes every other model stronger.

---

## Section 4: The Unreported Crime Data Question

The Facebook-sourced unreported crime dataset is genuinely unique. It captures crimes that TT community members reported to each other on Facebook — not to police, not to newspapers — and therefore invisible to every other data source. As a window into the true incidence of crime versus the reported incidence, it has real public safety and research value.

**Why it is valuable:**

The gap between actual crime and reported crime is a fundamental problem in criminology. In the Caribbean context specifically, under-reporting to police is driven by fear of retaliation, distrust of institutions, and community norms. A dataset that even partially captures this gap is genuinely significant — not just as a research curiosity but as a corrective lens on official statistics that systematically undercount the safety problem facing communities.

**The ethical dimensions:**

The people posting to TT Facebook community groups were communicating with their community in a moment of distress, need, or urgency. They were not consenting to data aggregation. They were not contributing to a research platform. They did not expect their posts to appear on a public website or be sold to an insurer.

This is not a hypothetical concern. The individuals involved may be identifiable from incident details (date, location, description of victim or perpetrator). They may be vulnerable. They may face consequences if their post surfaces in a commercial context they never anticipated.

**Does aggregation change the ethical calculus?**

Yes, meaningfully. The ethical objection to commercialising raw incident data from Facebook posts is strong — those are individual peoples' accounts, not a consented dataset. Publishing or selling "on 14 January 2026, a woman in X area reported being followed to her car" crosses an ethical line regardless of whether the same story appeared nowhere else.

Aggregate statistics — "Area X has an estimated 40% unreported crime premium above official statistics" — are a different category entirely. No individual is identifiable. The public interest in making this information available is real. The commercial application (an insurer understanding that official TTPS data undercounts by a meaningful margin in certain areas) serves a legitimate risk-assessment purpose.

**The labour dimension:**

The owner is investing personal time to read and enter these posts. That labour has created something of real value. Recognising that value commercially is not inherently wrong. The question is how it is framed: the owner is not selling other people's posts — the owner is selling analytical work product derived from community observation, which is closer to journalism than to data brokerage.

**Recommendation:**

1. Raw incident data from Facebook posts should never sit behind a paywall, and should be presented publicly with minimal identifying detail (area-level, not address-level; category, not specific description).

2. Aggregate statistics derived from this data (unreported crime premium by area, comparison of reported vs actual crime rates) can ethically sit in an institutional data tier, provided the methodology is transparent (i.e. "derived from community social media monitoring, not police data") and the aggregate nature is made explicit.

3. The weekly blog and public dashboard should continue to incorporate insights from this data without individual attribution.

4. Any institutional client using this data should understand its provenance and the aggregate nature of what they are purchasing.

5. As the platform matures, consider publishing a clear data ethics statement on the site — this protects the platform legally and signals professionalism to institutional buyers.

## Section 5: Growth Strategy — Expanding to Full Caribbean

### RSS Landscape by Island

| Island | Primary Sources | RSS Availability | Crime Coverage Quality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jamaica | Jamaica Observer, Jamaica Gleaner | Yes — both have functional RSS | Excellent — high crime volume, detailed reporting | Highest priority after TT. Diaspora in UK, US, Canada is large |
| Barbados | Nation News, Barbados Today | Nation News: yes. Barbados Today: partial | Good — moderate crime volume | Smaller island, lower absolute volume |
| Guyana | Kaieteur News, Stabroek News | Both have RSS | High volume, improving quality | Underserved market, high crime relevance |
| Bahamas | Nassau Guardian, Tribune 242 | Tribune 242: yes. Nassau Guardian: partial | Good, Nassau-concentrated | Significant US-adjacent commercial value |
| St Lucia | St Lucia Times, Voice of St Lucia | Limited RSS quality | Moderate volume | Lower priority — small population |
| St Vincent | iWitness News | Functional RSS | Low-moderate volume | Lower priority |
| Grenada | Now Grenada | Functional RSS | Low volume | Lower priority |
| Belize | Channel 5 Belize, Amandala | Partial RSS | Moderate volume | Worth monitoring |

### Facebook Community Monitoring at Scale

The manual Facebook entry layer is the most valuable and the least scalable component of the platform. At 2–5 hours/week total bandwidth, the realistic picture is:

- TT alone currently consumes the majority of that manual entry time.
- Adding one additional island with active Facebook community monitoring would require either finding a local volunteer contributor or accepting RSS-only data for new islands.
- Running 3+ islands with the Facebook layer active is not achievable as a solo operation without either paid part-time help or a community contributor model.

**Recommendation:** Expand to new islands via RSS-only pipeline first. The automated pipeline can handle Jamaica, Guyana, and Bahamas at near-zero marginal effort. The Facebook layer stays TT-only until there is funding to support local data contributors.

### Prioritisation Framework

| Rank | Island | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Jamaica | Largest Caribbean diaspora globally (UK, US, Canada), highest crime volume, strong RSS sources, highest commercial data value for insurers |
| 2 | Guyana | Fast-growing economy (oil boom), active diaspora, Kaieteur News RSS is reliable, high crime relevance |
| 3 | Bahamas | US proximity creates commercial interest from US insurers and businesses, Tribune 242 RSS is solid |
| 4 | Barbados | Smaller but highly active tourism economy, Nation News RSS good, serves insurer interest in tourist-facing crime risk |
| 5 | Belize | English-speaking, active crime scene, underserved by data |

### Realistic Expansion Timeline

Given 2–5 hours/week and current manual workflow:

- **Months 1–6:** TT only. Stabilise automation, grow traffic, activate newsletter.
- **Months 6–12:** Add Jamaica via RSS-only automated pipeline. No manual Facebook layer initially. Estimated setup effort: 8–12 hours.
- **Months 12–18:** Add Guyana via RSS pipeline. Begin documenting Jamaica Facebook group landscape for future manual layer consideration.
- **Months 18–36:** Add Bahamas and Barbados. At this point, if grant funding or first institutional revenue has arrived, consider a paid part-time data assistant for Facebook monitoring on 1–2 islands.

This is a conservative timeline that respects the bandwidth constraint. Trying to add 3 islands simultaneously would degrade data quality on all of them.

### Value Inflection Points

- **3 islands (TT + Jamaica + Guyana):** Regional Caribbean insurers become a realistic prospect. A platform covering the three highest-crime English-speaking Caribbean nations is a meaningful regional resource.
- **5 islands:** Sagicor (which operates across Barbados, Jamaica, TT, and other Caribbean markets) becomes a realistic institutional prospect. A single relationship with Sagicor at this point could be transformative.
- **8–10 islands:** International reinsurers with Caribbean exposure (Lloyd's syndicates, Munich Re Caribbean desk) take notice. IDB and CDB become more receptive grant applicants. Academic partnerships become realistic.
- **Full Caribbean coverage:** Genuinely significant institutional resource. At this point the platform is not just a TT crime site — it is Caribbean crime infrastructure.

---

## Section 6: The 1.5 Years Data Question

### What Can Be Credibly Offered Now

- Current crime trends (what is rising, what is falling in 2025–2026)
- Area comparisons (which areas are the highest-risk, which are improving)
- One full year-on-year comparison (2025 vs 2024 for most crime types)
- Crime type breakdowns with meaningful incident counts for major categories (murder, robbery, assault)
- Seasonal patterns (at 1.5 years, one full seasonal cycle is visible)
- Near-real-time updates (the recency advantage is genuine and unique)

### What Cannot Yet Be Offered

- Actuarial credibility: Underwriters need minimum 5 years of data to price risk with confidence. At 1.5 years, the dataset can inform qualitative risk assessment but not actuarial pricing models.
- Multi-year longitudinal studies: Academic credibility requires peer-reviewable methodology and multi-cycle data. This is a 3–5 year play.
- Statistically significant trend reversals: Confirming that a crime trend has genuinely reversed (rather than fluctuated) requires enough cycles to separate signal from noise. Two to three years is the minimum.
- Regression analysis with seasonal controls: Needs at least 3 full annual cycles.

### Extending Backwards: Public Historical Sources

| Source | Coverage | Accessibility | Effort to integrate |
|---|---|---|---|
| TTPS Annual Crime Reports | National aggregates by type, 10+ years | Published on TTPS website, PDF format | High effort — PDF extraction, not incident-level |
| UWI Crime Research (St Augustine) | Academic studies, various years | Library access, some public | Moderate — aggregate, not incident-level |
| UNODC Caribbean crime statistics | Regional, annual aggregates | Public online | Low effort — already structured, but very aggregate |
| TT newspaper digital archives (Express, Guardian, Newsday) | Incident reports, 5–10 years | Not structured, would require scraping | Very high effort — legal and technical |

**Practical recommendation:** Integrate UNODC national-level TT data as context for the platform (a "historical context" page showing TT crime rates back to 2010 at national level). This is achievable in a few hours and extends the narrative depth significantly without requiring incident-level historical scraping. TTPS annual reports can be manually summarised at national level to create a "historical snapshot" page.

### Value Inflection Points

| Milestone | What Unlocks |
|---|---|
| 2 years (mid-2026) | Full two-year YoY comparison. First seasonal cycle confirmed. Journalists can write credible trend pieces. Insurance sector outreach becomes viable. |
| 3 years (mid-2027) | Multi-year trend analysis. Preliminary actuarial utility. First realistic academic citation potential. Grant applications gain credibility. |
| 5 years (mid-2029) | Genuine actuarial dataset. Multi-cycle seasonal analysis. Institutional data licence conversations become realistic with major regional insurers. |

**Honest timeline:** CrimeHotSpots becomes a genuinely serious academic and institutional resource around 2028–2029, assuming consistent data collection. This is not discouraging — it is simply the reality of longitudinal data. The platform is building something that compounds in value over time. Every month of consistent collection is an investment in future commercial and academic value.

## Section 7: Competitive Landscape

### InSight Crime

InSight Crime is a foundation-funded (501c3 non-profit) investigative journalism and research organisation focused on organised crime and criminal groups in Latin America and the Caribbean. It produces long-form analytical reports on gangs, drug trafficking, extortion networks, and institutional corruption. It is funded primarily by foundation grants (including Open Society Foundations, IDB) and research partnerships.

**What they do not do:** InSight Crime does not collect, publish, or maintain incident-level street crime data. They do not publish daily or weekly crime statistics. They have no area-level granularity. They are a qualitative macro-analysis organisation, not a data platform.

**The gap CrimeHotSpots fills:** Near-real-time, quantitative, incident-level, geographically granular data for everyday street crime. InSight Crime covers the criminal ecosystem; CrimeHotSpots covers the criminal events. These are complementary, not competitive. InSight Crime could be a future media partner or citation source.

### ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data)

ACLED is a global conflict data project that covers political violence, armed conflict, demonstrations, and riots. It does include Caribbean data. It is used extensively by academics, NGOs, and governments.

**The gap:** ACLED explicitly excludes everyday crime — robbery, burglary, assault, sexual offences, and murder outside of political or gang conflict contexts. Their methodology treats a murder by a gang member as "organised violence" but does not capture the vast majority of crime that affects ordinary citizens. For a Caribbean insurer or a citizen trying to understand neighbourhood safety, ACLED is not useful.

### TTPS Published Statistics

The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service publishes annual crime statistics on its website. These are national aggregates by crime type, published months after the year ends.

**The gap:** Not incident-level. Not area-level. Not real-time. Not searchable. Not machine-readable. Published once a year. No trend visualisations. No comparison tools. The TTPS data is useful as a historical benchmark but is not a substitute for what CrimeHotSpots provides.

### Global Crime Index, Numbeo, Similar

Survey-based aggregate indices that rank countries or cities by perceived crime levels. Useful for macro comparisons but not incident-level, not area-level, and not updated frequently.

**The gap:** Survey perception is not the same as incident data. These tools tell you that Port of Spain is perceived as more dangerous than Bridgetown. They cannot tell you which areas within Port of Spain have the highest robbery rates or whether crime in Arima has increased in the past 90 days.

### The Blue Ocean

**Nobody in the Caribbean provides near-real-time, incident-level, geographically granular crime data for everyday street crime.** This is not a slight gap — it is a complete absence of any comparable resource. InSight Crime covers macro organised crime. ACLED covers political violence. TTPS covers national aggregates annually. Nobody covers what CrimeHotSpots covers: the day-to-day crime data that affects citizens, businesses, insurers, and journalists making real decisions.

At full Caribbean coverage, this is a genuinely significant infrastructure gap filled. The opportunity is not theoretical.

## Section 8: Recommendations

### Recommended Monetisation Model

**Model E (Mixed) with this sequencing:**

The fund-growth goal means revenue is a means to an end, not the end itself. The sequencing must reflect the actual constraints: building audience takes priority over revenue extraction in 2026. Revenue targets in 2026 are modest: cover operational costs. Revenue targets in 2027–2028 are more ambitious: fund island expansion.

The recommended model combines: free platform always + newsletter with paid tier (12-month horizon) + institutional data tier (18-month horizon) + one grant application (12-month horizon). Community donations (Ko-fi) remain as a background channel but are not planned as primary revenue.

### What Should Always Remain Free

- All public dashboard views (area summaries, crime type breakdowns, trend indicators)
- All individual crime detail pages
- All area profile pages
- The weekly blog and headlines archive
- The weekly newsletter (free tier)
- Any tool that helps a citizen assess their own neighbourhood's safety

**Reasoning:** The platform's entire institutional and commercial value is built on being the trusted public resource. Paywalling any core citizen-facing feature destroys the credibility and SEO foundation that makes everything else possible. Free access is not a sacrifice — it is the strategy.

### What Could Ethically Sit Behind a Premium Tier

- Bulk CSV data exports (full dataset, updated quarterly)
- API access with authentication and rate limiting
- Custom area analysis reports prepared by the owner
- Aggregate statistics derived from unreported crime data (with transparent methodology)
- Institutional annual data licences
- Premium newsletter tier with deeper analysis and area-specific briefings

**Ethical framing:** None of these paywalled items are things a citizen needs to be safe. They are research tools for organisations with analytical and commercial purposes. The ethical line is clear: citizen safety information is always free. Research-grade data products for institutional use can carry a cost.

### Top 3 Immediate Actions (0–6 Months)

**Action 1: Activate the newsletter this week.**
Send the first issue to the existing 0–50 subscribers regardless of list size. Use the automated weekly blog post as the editorial core — add two paragraphs of context, a chart or data highlight, and a Ko-fi link. Commit to weekly sends. A newsletter with a 6-month consistent track record is worth ten times more than a dormant one for every purpose that matters: grant applications, institutional credibility, audience growth.

**Action 2: Execute one focused SEO push to accelerate from ~20 to 100+ visitors/day.**
The organic foundation is already working: position 7.5 average, 5.9% CTR, ~300 impressions/day. The lever is moving from position 7–10 to position 3–5 on the queries already driving impressions. Identify the top 10–15 search queries currently generating impressions in GSC, check which pages are ranking for them, and improve those pages: better title tags, stronger meta descriptions, more complete content answering the query. This is a one-time audit achievable in 4–6 hours with high ROI given the existing impression base.

**Action 3: Register a TT company.**
This unblocks grant applications, enables institutional contracts, and costs approximately TTD 1,500–2,000 in registration fees. Without a legal entity, the platform cannot receive grant funding from CDB, IDB, or UNDP. This is a 4–6 week process through the Companies Registry and should be started now.

### Top 3 Actions for 12–24 Month Horizon

**Action 1: Begin structured institutional outreach to the insurance sector (Month 12).**
By month 12, the dataset should be approaching 2.5 years deep. Prepare a one-page data capability sheet — what data is available, at what geographic granularity, with what update frequency, at what cost. Identify specific contacts at Sagicor General Insurance, COLFIRE, Guardian General, and Beacon Insurance via LinkedIn and industry directories. Send 5–8 cold emails with a data sample attached. Expect a 3–6 month sales cycle. One paying institutional client changes the financial picture materially.

**Action 2: Expand to Jamaica via automated RSS pipeline (Month 12–18).**
Jamaica is the highest-priority expansion: large diaspora, strong RSS sources (Observer, Gleaner), highest commercial data value. The technical setup replicates the TT pipeline with minimal modification. Once live, CrimeHotSpots becomes a two-island Caribbean resource, which strengthens every institutional relationship and grant application.

**Action 3: Submit one grant application to UNDP Caribbean or Open Society Foundations (Month 6–12).**
Target: $10,000–20,000 for platform expansion and data infrastructure. The application narrative is strong — public-interest crime data transparency, underserved Caribbean communities, unique dataset. Register the company first (Action 3 above). Allow 2–3 months for application preparation given bandwidth constraints. Success rate for first-time applicants is 10–20%, but the process itself clarifies the value proposition and builds relationships regardless of outcome.

### What Success Looks Like at 2 Years (February 2028)

- **Traffic:** 150–300 visitors/day (from a ~20/day baseline today, via SEO improvement + Jamaica coverage + newsletter referrals)
- **Newsletter:** 600–1,000 free subscribers, 40–80 paid subscribers ($8/month), generating $320–640/month
- **Islands covered:** TT + Jamaica active, Guyana in pipeline
- **Institutional relationships:** 1–2 paying institutional clients (insurers or risk consultancies) generating $300–600/month combined
- **Grant funding:** One successful application ($10,000–25,000) received and deployed toward expansion
- **Monthly revenue:** $700–1,500/month total, covering operational costs and beginning to fund expansion
- **Data depth:** 3+ years of TT data, 12–18 months of Jamaica data
- **Credibility:** Cited by at least 2 TT/Caribbean media organisations, referenced in at least 1 academic or NGO report

This is not a hockey-stick growth story. It is a steady, compounding build that reaches operational self-sufficiency and begins funding the Caribbean expansion mission by 2028.
