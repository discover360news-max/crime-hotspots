# Crime Hotspots — Monetization Strategy

**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026
**Current Status:** Planning Phase (4 visitors/day)
**Target for Monetization:** 1000+ visitors/day

---

## Core Principle

**NO AD HELL.** We will never subject users to intrusive advertising like Trinidad Express's ad-saturated experience. Our monetization must be subtle, value-driven, and maintain the site's clean, professional aesthetic.

**Key Philosophy:** "When something is free, you are the product" — but we can monetize ethically through B2B services while keeping the core user experience 100% free and ad-free.

## Revenue Streams to AVOID

These strategies violate our "no ad hell" principle and will **never** be implemented:

❌ **Google AdSense / Display Ad Networks**
- Reason: Clutters UI, slows site, poor user experience

❌ **Pop-ups / Interstitials / Takeover Ads**
- Reason: Extremely intrusive, damages trust

❌ **Native Ads Disguised as Content**
- Reason: Deceptive, erodes editorial integrity

❌ **Paywalling Core Statistics**
- Reason: Violates mission to provide accessible public safety data

❌ **Email Harvesting for Third-Party Marketing**
- Reason: Privacy violation, unethical

❌ **Autoplay Video Ads**
- Reason: Annoying, high bandwidth, accessibility issues

❌ **Clickbait / Sensationalized Headlines**
- Reason: Damages credibility, exploits tragedy for clicks
