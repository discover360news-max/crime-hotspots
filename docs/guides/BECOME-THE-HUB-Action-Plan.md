# Become THE Hub: SEO Action Plan

**Goal:** Be the go-to destination for Trinidad crime information
**Created:** January 21, 2026
**Based on:** Google Search Console data (28-day analysis)

---

## Current Baseline (January 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Daily Clicks | 2.4 |
| Total Impressions | 1,820 |
| CTR | 3.7% |
| Average Position | 8.1 |
| Indexed Pages | 527 |

## Key Finding

**Google sees crimehotspots.com as a crime NEWS site, not a crime STATISTICS site.**

Individual incident pages rank well (position 2-8), but dashboard/statistics pages are invisible for high-value queries:

| Target Query | Current Position |
|--------------|------------------|
| "crime statistics in trinidad and tobago" | 67 |
| "trinidad and tobago crime statistics" | 56 |
| "trinidad crime statistics" | 63 |
| "trinidad crime rate" | 72-89 |
| "how many murders in trinidad for 2026" | 10 |
