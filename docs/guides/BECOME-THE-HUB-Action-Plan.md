## Key Finding

**Google sees crimehotspots.com as a crime NEWS site, not a crime STATISTICS site.**

Individual incident pages rank well (position 2-8), but dashboard/statistics pages are invisible for high-value queries:

| Target Query | Current Position |
|--------------|------------------|
| "crime statistics in trinidad and tobago" | 67 |
| "trinidad and tobago crime statistics" | 56 |
| "trinidad crime statistics" | 63 |
| "trinidad crime rate" | 72-89 |
| "how many murders in trinidad for 2026" | 10 |
