## Platform Overview

CrimeHotSpots.com is the only near-real-time, incident-level crime data platform covering Trinidad & Tobago.

Data is collected via automated RSS monitoring of TT news sources and manual curation of community-reported incidents — capturing both reported and unreported crime activity invisible to official statistics.

Our structured dataset spans 18 months of incidents, updated daily, with geolocation, crime type classification, and victim count for each record.

All data is licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0) for academic and non-commercial use; institutional licences are available for commercial applications.

## The Unreported Crime Layer

The "dark figure" of crime refers to incidents never officially reported to police and therefore absent from government statistics. CrimeHotSpots manually curates community-reported incidents from Trinidad & Tobago Facebook groups, capturing crimes invisible to official sources.

To protect community members, this data is provided as aggregate statistics only — not raw incident-level records. This represents a unique dataset with no equivalent source in the Caribbean, providing analysts with a fuller picture of the true crime environment.
